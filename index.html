## Executive Summary
This analysis explores **5.5 million+ observations** from Cyclistic’s bike-share data to identify growth opportunities for annual memberships. Key findings reveal a distinct **leisure duration gap**, where casual riders use bikes 2x longer than members, primarily on weekends. By closing this gap, there is a projected **$13.2M revenue opportunity** through targeted conversion strategies.
### Data Overview
```{r data-load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Loading the pre-processed summary data
cyclistic_final <- read_csv("Cyclistic_Tableau_Summary.csv")

# Quick look at the data structure
head(cyclistic_final)
```
### Behavioral Analysis & Visualizations

```{r seasonal-trends, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 1. SEASONAL TRENDS
ggplot(data = cyclistic_final) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = season, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Rides by Season: Member vs Casual",
       subtitle = "Analysis of 5.5 Million+ Observations",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "User Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Insight: The Conversion Window**
> Casual ridership peaks significantly between March and August. This confirms that a **Seasonal "Summer Pass"** should be the primary marketing vehicle.

```{r time-of-day, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 2. TIME OF DAY ANALYSIS 
ggplot(data = cyclistic_final) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = time_of_day, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  labs(title = "Ride Patterns by Time of Day & Season",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

> **Insight: The Behavioral Deep-Dive**
> Casual riders dominate the **Afternoon/Evening "Leisure Pulse"**. Our strategy must target these leisure windows to convert weekend users.

```{r trip-duration, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 3. AVERAGE TRIP DURATION
cyclistic_final %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(avg_ride = mean(avg_duration_mins, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = avg_ride, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Ride Duration (Minutes)",
       subtitle = "Casual riders double the active duration of members",
       y = "Average Minutes",
       x = "User Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Insight: The Leisure Gap**
> Casual riders average **22 minutes per ride**, doubling the member average. This proves we are selling a leisure experience that needs a tailored membership tier.

```{r monthly-trends, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 4. MONTHLY GROWTH TRENDS
cyclistic_final %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Ride Trends: Seasonal Growth",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_classic()
```

> **Insight: Preparing for Launch**
> Marketing spend must be front-loaded in Q1 to capture the full seasonal surge.

```{r bike-type, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 5. BIKE TYPE PREFERENCE
ggplot(data = cyclistic_final) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = rideable_type, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Preference of Bike Types: Members vs Casual",
       x = "Type of Bike",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "User Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Insight: The Electric Leverage**
> Casual riders prefer electric bikes. **"Electric Bike Priority"** for members would be a high-value incentive to upgrade.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the identified **$13.2M revenue opportunity**, I recommend the following:

* **Seasonal "Summer Pass"**: Launch high-intensity marketing between March and August to capture the casual segment during peak 22-minute average ride windows.
* **Electric Bike Priority**: Leverage the strong casual preference for electric bikes by offering "Member-Only" priority access during peak weekend hours.
* **Commuter Conversion**: Target the "Morning/Evening Pulse" with personalized membership trials for casual riders active during standard commute hours.
