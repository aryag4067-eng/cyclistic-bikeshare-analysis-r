## Executive Summary
This analysis explores **5.5 million+ observations** from Cyclistic’s bike-share data to identify growth opportunities for annual memberships. Key findings reveal a distinct **leisure duration gap**, where casual riders use bikes 2x longer than members, primarily on weekends. By closing this gap, there is a projected **$13.2M revenue opportunity** through targeted conversion strategies.
### Data Overview
```{r data-load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Loading the pre-processed summary data
cyclistic_final <- read_csv("Cyclistic_Tableau_Summary.csv")

# Quick look at the data structure
head(cyclistic_final)
```
### Behavioral Analysis & Visualizations
```{r analysis-viz, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 1. SEASONAL TRENDS
ggplot(data = cyclistic_final) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = season, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Rides by Season: Member vs Casual",
       subtitle = "Analysis of 5.5 Million+ Rides",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "User Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# 2. TIME OF DAY ANALYSIS
ggplot(data = cyclistic_final) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = time_of_day, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  labs(title = "Ride Patterns by Time of Day & Season",

       y = "Total Rides") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

# 3. AVERAGE TRIP DURATION
cyclistic_final %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(avg_ride = mean(avg_duration_mins, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = avg_ride, fill = member_casual)) +
