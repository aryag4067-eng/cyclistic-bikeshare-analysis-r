# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: Membership Conversion Strategy

## Executive Summary: $13M+ Revenue Opportunity
* **The Problem**: 40% of Cyclistic’s 5.5M+ annual trips are generated by "Casual" riders. While these users stay on bikes 2x longer than members, they lack a structured retention path, leading to volatile revenue and missed long-term value.
* **The Solution**: A cloud-engineered strategic analysis identifying two high-intent conversion windows: the "Weekend Leisure" segment and the "Q2 Seasonal Surge." Technical Moat:
* **BigQuery & GCS Architecture**: Engineered a cloud-to-cloud data pipeline to process 5.5M+ rows, bypassing local hardware limitations.
* **Data Integrity**: Resolved missing station metadata for electric bikes by identifying "On-Street Lock" patterns, preserving dataset volume where standard cleaning would have resulted in a 15% data loss.

Business Intelligence: Translated raw ride-length variance into a Financial Impact Model, projecting $13.2M in recurring annual revenue through a targeted 5% conversion strategy.

## Tools & Technologies
* **Google BigQuery**: SQL-based cleaning and large-scale data processing.
* **RStudio (R)**: Primary environment for deep-dive statistical analysis and professional visualizations.
* **Tableau Public**: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arya.gupta4856/viz/CyclisticCaseStudyData-DrivenMembershipConversionStrategy/Dashboard1?publish=yes]
- Optimized for executive storytelling.
* **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Leveraged as a "Staging Area" for high-speed cloud-to-cloud data ingestion.

## Challenges & "Smart Work" Solutions
* **Challenge: Browser Ingestion Limits**: Direct local uploads to BigQuery were capped. I bypassed these limits by engineering a **Cloud-to-Cloud transfer** (GCS to BigQuery).
* **Challenge: Data Integrity Gaps**: Identified missing station names for electric bike trips. Instead of biased deletion, I maintained the 5.5M+ row count by recognizing these as "On-Street Locks."

### Business Objectives
* **Business Task**: Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Data Engineering & Pipeline Architecture
* **Ingestion**: Engineered a cloud-native pipeline using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to bypass 1GB browser upload limits, enabling the processing of the full 5.5M+ row dataset.
* **Processing**: Leveraged BigQuery SQL for high-speed cleaning, removing "maintenance" ghost rides and calculating temporal variables (ride_length, day_of_week).
* **Statistical Deep-Dive**: Integrated R (tidyverse) to perform distribution analysis and mean-variance testing between user segments.

### Key Behavioral Insights
* **The Commuter Baseline**: Annual members exhibit high-frequency, low-duration trips concentrated during weekday peak hours (8 AM / 5 PM), indicating a stable utility-based user base.
* **The Weekend Engagement Gap**: Casual ridership peaks on weekends with 2x higher average ride duration compared to members. This identifies a high-value leisure segment currently paying a "convenience premium."
* **Seasonality (The Conversion Window)**: A massive ridership surge begins in March (Q2). This represents the optimal "Marketing Strike Zone" for membership conversion before peak summer usage.

## Strategic Financial Modeling
**To quantify the "Engagement Gap," I developed a revenue projection model targeting a 5% conversion of the high-intent Casual segment**:
1. **Segment Potential**: 2.2M+ annual casual rides.
2. **Projected Revenue**: Estimated $13.2M in Recurring Annual Revenue (ARR), assuming a $120/year membership valuation.
3. **Strategic Value**: Shifting high-duration casual users to memberships stabilizes cash flow and increases Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by 20-25%.

###  Strategic Roadmap: 2026 Growth Plan
1. **Q1 Preparation (The "Targeting" Phase)**: Deploy localized digital ads at top-performing "Casual" start stations identified in the analysis to build awareness before the spring surge.
2. **Q2 Execution (The "Conversion" Window)**: Launch the "Cyclistic Weekend Pass" in March. Data indicates this is the primary entry point for high-duration users; capturing them here maximizes Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).
3. **Q4 Retention**: Transition seasonal summer riders into discounted annual memberships during the October dip to stabilize winter cash flow and increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
